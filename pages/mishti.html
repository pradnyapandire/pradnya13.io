<p>
Sweets and Bengal have had a longer relationship than even Tagore and Bengal! The sweets of Bengal are probably the best that India has to offer and mishti doi is one of their most famous. It is made with gur (molasses) and thick creamy milk. Unsweetened curd is added to it to give the whole thing some texture and thickness. This sweet dish is definitely one of the favourites for all Bengalis.
