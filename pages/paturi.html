<html><body><B> Ilish Bhaja/Paturi<B/>
<p>These dishes utilise the flavours of the tasty Hilsa fish, which is common to Bengal and its waters. Ilish bhaja is simply fried Hilsa. While paturi is a more elaborate affair. In ilish paturi, the fish is marinated in a thick coating of mustard paste and cooked inside banana leaves. This is one fish that people can never stop eating in Bengal. Unfortunately, ilish is available only during the monsoon.
