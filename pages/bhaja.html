<p>Bengal as a state is known for its love for fishes and sweets. But, they also harbour great love for the humble eggplant. Nothing professes it better than their begun bhaja or fried eggplant dish. This is a frequently offered starter at Bengali weddings. It is usually served during the afternoon bhoj, with dal and bhaat. It is either coated with besan and deep fried, or marinated in turmeric, salt and shallow fried. Either way it tastes heavenly!
