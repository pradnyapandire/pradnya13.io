<p>
The traditional preparation of this dish is quite elaborate and involves the use of spicy masala, toor dal (a type of lentil) and vegetables. Spices like nutmeg, asafoetida, curry leaves and tamarind pulp contribute to its unique flavour and taste. Some versions of the dish are prepared with up to thirty ingredients.

It is served hot and sometimes eaten with chatni, boondi, salad, papad, or potato chips. This dish is commonly found in restaurants that serve the Udupi cuisine. The masala used is available off the shelf.
