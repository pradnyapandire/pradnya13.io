<p>
This is a simple yet delicious dessert that just has to be present at all important Bengali functions, including weddings. It is prepared with chhena, sugar and cardamom. Sometimes, other spices and nuts like pistachio, almonds and cashews are also used to add more flavour to the sandesh. It is a common sight at weddings to see the old and the young alike devouring this sweet with glee.
