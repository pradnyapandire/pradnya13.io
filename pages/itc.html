<h2><B>About ITC Grand Central</B></h2>
True to the its name, ITC Grand Central is located in the heart of Mumbai, in Lower Parel, with easy access to all parts of the city. The luxury hotel exudes an old-world charm, with its British colonial-inspired architecture and grand interiors. Apart from its 242 guest rooms and some of the most stellar restaurants — think, Kebabs & Kurries and Shanghai Club — the hotel also has an elegant banquet hall and unmatched services. The stately, pillar-less Ballroom, complete with mirror-and-wood paneling and vintage chandeliers, and the more intimate CJ's, are perfect for both private and corporate events. Have a large reception to host and prefer the outdoors? The gorgeous Terrace Garden at ITC Grand Central with patches of green and the dome pavilion, is made for a cocktail set-up with great views of the city.
