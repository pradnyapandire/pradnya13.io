<p>
This is a perennial favourite of biryani lovers and a must have for anyone who loves chicken. The Bengalis also add potato and boiled eggs to their biryani. This gives another dimension to it. The typical Bengali wedding biryani has more chicken than potato and that is what makes it stand out from the biryanis you will find anywhere else.
