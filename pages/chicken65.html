<p>
Chicken 65 is a spicy, deep-fried chicken dish originating from Chennai, India, as an entree, or quick snack. The flavor of the dish can be attributed to red chillies but the exact set of ingredients for the recipe can vary. It can be prepared using boneless or bone-in chicken and is usually served with onion and lemon garnish. Vegetarian variants like "Paneer 65" or "Gobi 65" use paneer (cottage cheese) or cauliflower instead. While the name "Chicken 65" is universally used to refer to the dish, there are many different theories claiming its origins.
