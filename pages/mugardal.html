<B> Maachher Muro Diye Muger Dal:</B><br></br>
<p>This is one of the few dishes that are popular, despite the fact that it utilises a part of the fish that some may find disgusting to have on their plates. Moong dal is commonly used to supplement the marinated fish heads with a curry base. The fish heads and the pulses are cooked together with the spices. Bay leaves and green chilies are added to the flavourful mix. The fish heads, actually add a whole new depth of flavour to the dal.</p>
