<p>
Razma is a popular South Asian vegetarian dish consisting of red kidney beans in a thick gravy with many Indian whole spices and usually served with rice and food. Although the kidney bean is not of South Asian origin, it is a part of regular diet in Northern India and Nepal. The dish developed after the red kidney bean was brought to South Asia from Mexico.[3] Being a popular dish, it is prepared on important occasions. A 100 gram serving of boiled Rajma beans contain about 140 calories, 5.7 grams of protein, 5.9 grams of fat and 18 grams of carbohydrate. Rajma chawal, i.e. Rajma served with boiled rice, is a popular dish throughout northern India and Nepal..
