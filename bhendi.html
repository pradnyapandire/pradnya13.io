<B>Shingara:</B><br></br>
<p>The shingara (samosa) is a very popular Indian street food. You will rarely find an Indian who has not eaten a samosa ever. Every state has a different interpretation of it and Bengal is no exception. They add their own dash of Bengal to it by using mustard oil, red chilies, gingers and a few different varieties of spices. At Bengali weddings, the shingara is sometimes offered as a snack when the guests have just started arriving. If it is a winter wedding, then expect delicious aloo fulkopir shingaras (samosas stuffed with mouth-watering potato and cauliflower mix). Sounds better than your regular fare of pakodas, right?</p>
