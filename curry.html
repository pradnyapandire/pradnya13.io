<p>
This great prawn curry is superbly succulent. It contains a mixed bag of flavours from spicy to sweet. The many weddings of Bengal feature this dish. The prawns are of course sourced from Bengal’s great fish markets, and you can bet that they will be full of flavour. The curry is cooked with coconut milk and shredded bits of coconut. Coconut milk is added to give it softness. It is almost ethereal the way this dish tastes!
