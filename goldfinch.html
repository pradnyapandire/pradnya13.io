<h2><B>About Goldfinch</B></h2>
Goldfinch, Andheri, Mumbai, has an elegant 3,000 sq. ft. banquet hall - Bay Leaf, that can host a large wedding or reception. The pillared space has understated décor in earthy tones and can be decorated to suit a wedding or a conference. Planning to have your wedding reception at the same venue? Consider the gorgeous terrace on the 8th floor of the 4-star hotel. It has an upper and lower deck, a sparkling pool and a lush garden area. The rooftop at Goldfinch is just as good for a cocktail party at sunset.
