<p>
Clearly, they love their fishes and know how to cook them like a pro. The pulao and fish kalia in Bengali weddings is a favourite combination. The rohu fish is marinated in a bunch of aromatic spices and cooked with yogurt, onion, tomato and raisin. The gravy tastes heavenly when paired with mishti pulao.
