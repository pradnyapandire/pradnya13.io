<h2><B>About  Grand Hotel</B></h2>
Located within the prime business hub Mindspace and just off the busy Link Road; Grand Hometel, Goregaon, Mumbai, is a favourite venue for weddings and corporate events. The lobby-level carpeted banquet hall is endowed with natural light flooding in through the large windows. Looking for something more small-scale? The comfortable meeting room at Grand Hometel has stately wood panelling and can add grace to any private or corporate event. If you've got a private event planned, the open-air rooftop banquet area Panorama has a beautiful view of the neighbourhood. The added glamour of the pool makes it perfect for a sangeet.
