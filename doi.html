<p>This is another favourite present in plenty of Bengali weddings! In fact, this one is the piece de résistance of any Bengali wedding. This Bengali fish curry is unique because even though the gravy is made of unsweetened curd, it is sweet to taste. It lends itself beautifully to the palette. You will remember its taste long after you have savoured it at the wedding. The choice of fish for this dish is the again rohu.
